# Recipe Wizard

Since 0.2.0-pre-2, Croparia IF has provided a tool to conveniently generate recipes for infusor and ritual stand.

You can only get this tool in creative item tabs (Croparia).

## Usage for infusor

1. It is recommended to disable infusor by [commands](Commands) or [config](Configurations)
2. Throw the input item onto the infusor
3. Make sure the infusor is correctly infused by elemental potions
4. Hold the output item in your offhand
5. Use recipe wizard on the infusor, and the result is dumped to the [`dumpPath`](Configurations). You can quickly view it via clicking on the message popped in the chatbox
6. Before you put the recipe into your datapack, it is recommended to check whether the `item nbt` and `block property` is in your need. Recipe wizard will always try to dump all information from the game instance.

## Usage for ritual stand

1. It is recommended to disable ritual stand by [commands](Commands) or [config](Configurations)
