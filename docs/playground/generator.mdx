# Generator Creator

Here you can create the generator easily. Note that you still need to test it in the game to ensure it works as expected.

You are recommended to refer to the [Generator API](../modpack/generator) and [Recipe Wizard - Custom Generators](../modpack/recipe_wizard/custom_generators) for more details.
