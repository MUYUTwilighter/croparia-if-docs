# Configurations

The configurations of Croparia IF can be found at `${game}/config/croparia.json`. You can modify it with any text editor
**while the game is not running**.

The config is read when the game starts up, or when you run `/reload` command in the game; and it will be saved back to
the file when the world is closed.

You can modify the configurations in-game with `/croparia <property> [value]` command.

### Crop Blacklist

The blacklist is a list of crop IDs or mod IDs.

If a crop's ID is in the blacklist, the crop will be not be created.

If a mod ID, which should be prefixed with `@`, is in the blacklist, all crops, or the materials of the crops, derived
from that mod will be ignored.

For example, if you put `@techreborn` in the blacklist, then all crops, like `croparia:tin`, will not be created.

However, if other mod that derives the tin crop, like Modern Industrialization, then the crop will still be created, but
you cannot get the `techreborn:tin_ingot` material from it.
