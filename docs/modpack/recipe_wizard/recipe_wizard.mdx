Recipe Wizard is a special item that can help you create and manage custom recipes in-game. It does not have GUI, but
reads the environment and your actions to create recipes.

You can define your own Recipe Wizard Generators that define how to create the recipe. Refer to
[Custom Generators](custom_generators) for more details.

Besides, it also provides some special actions performed when right-clicking certain blocks while sneaking. Refer to
[the list of supported actions](#supported-actions).

## Usage on creating recipes

Here we guide you through all the available generators provided by Croparia IF so that you know how it works.

### 1. Infusor Recipe

1. Infuse the infusor with element type you want. Refer to [Supported Actions](#supported-actions) for type-cycling.
2. Throw or place the input item onto the Infusor, then hold the output item in your offhand.
3. Right-click the Infusor with a Recipe Wizard in hand.
4. The recipe will be created and saved under `${game}/croparia/recipe_wizard/dumped`.

### 2. Ritual Recipe

1. Build the structure of the ritual. Refer to [Supported Actions](#supported-actions) that automatically build the
    structure for you.
2. Throw or place the input item onto the ritual, then hold the output item in your offhand.
3. Right-click the ritual with a Recipe Wizard in hand.
4. The recipe will be created and saved under `${game}/croparia/recipe_wizard/dumped`.

### 3. Soak Recipe

1. Set the elemental stone with an infusor with element type you want on top of it. Refer to
[Supported Actions](#supported-actions) that may help you set it.
2. Place the input block around the elemental stone, and the output block under the elemental stone.
3. Right-click the elemental stone with a Recipe Wizard in hand.
4. The recipe will be created and saved under `${game}/croparia/recipe_wizard/dumped`.
