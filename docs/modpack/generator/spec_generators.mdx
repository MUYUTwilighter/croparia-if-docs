# Spec: Generators

A generator is a tool that automates the creation of modpacks based on predefined templates and configurations. It is
defined as files in the `generators` folder of the file-pack provided by [Pack Handler](./#pack-handler).

Here we talk about the schema of built-in generator types provided by Croparia IF. If you are going to create/modify a
generator, please refer to the [Tutorial](tutorial) first, which also provides a [playground](tutorial/#playground) for
you to create a generator.

## Supported File Types

Croparia IF supports 3 file types for defining generators:
- **[TOML](https://toml.io/en/)** (`.toml`): Recommended. It is easy to read and write, and supports comments.
- **CDG** (`.cdg`): Croparia Data Generator, a custom format designed for Croparia IF. It does not support comments. See [below](#format-cdg) for details.
- **[JSON](https://toml.io/en/)** (`.json`): A widely used format, any other file types are eventually compiled into
JSON before decoding as generator. But it's less readable and writable than TOML and CDG. It does not support comments,
multi-line strings, etc.

### Format: CDG

CDG (Croparia Data Generator) is a custom format designed for Croparia IF. It is similar to TOML. We'll guide you
through the basics of CDG here.

#### i. Structure

A CDG file consists of 2 parts: **Meta** and **Template**.

- **Meta**: The header is the first non-empty line of the file. It specifies the meta of a generator. It starts with a
`@` character, followed by a key-value pair concatenated with a `=` character, and ends with a `;` character.
  - For example:
  ```
  @type=croparia:generator;
  ```
  - The key can only be a single word without spaces and special characters (`@`, `=` or `;`).
  - The value can be of following forms:
    - A single word without spaces and special characters (`@`, `=` or `;`).
    - A quoted string, which can contain spaces and special characters. You can use either double quotes (`"`) or
    single quotes (`'`) to quote a string. For example: `"croparia:generator"` or `'croparia:generator'`.
    - Multi-line strings quoted with triple quotes (`"""` or `'''`). For example:
    ```
    """
    This is a multi-line string.
    It can contain multiple lines.
    """
    ```
    - Any JSON value, including objects, arrays, numbers, booleans, and null. For example:
    ```
    {"key": "value", "array": [1, 2, 3], "number": 123, "boolean": true, "null": null}
    ```
- **Template**: The rest of the file is the template for the generated files. It can be any text, including
JSON, XML, etc. You can use placeholders in the template, which will be replaced with actual values during generation.
  - For example:
  ```
  {
    "type": "minecraft:crafting_shapeless",
    "ingredients": [
      "${fruit}"
    ],
    "result": {
      "item": "${material}",
      "count": 1
    }
  }
  ```

#### ii. Compilation

After compilation, a CDG file is converted to a JSON object with the following structure:

```json5
{
  "meta_str": "value1",
  "meta_num": 2,
  "meta_json": {"key": "value"},
  // And so on...
  "template": "template string"
}
```

## Generator Types

Croparia IF provides 3 built-in generator types: `croparia:generator`, `croparia:aggregated` and `croparia:lang`.

### i. `croparia:generator`

The default type of generator. It generates a file for each entry in a registry.

Available fields:
- `type` (`string`, required): The type of the generator. Must be `croparia:generator`.
- `dependencies` (array of arrays strings, optional): List of mod IDs that must be loaded for this generator to run.
  - If you specify **A Array of Arrays**, this generator will be available if **all** the arrays contain at least one mod that is loaded.
  - If you only specify **A Array**, this generator will be available if **any** of the mods in **The Array** are loaded.
  - If you only specify **A String**, this generator will be available if the mod represented by **The String** are loaded.
- `enabled` (`boolean`, optional, default: `true`): Whether to enable this generator.
- `startup` (`boolean`, optional, default: `false`): Whether to run this generator every time the pack is loaded, including the game
startup. If you want to access the tag system, you need to set this to false.
- `registry` (`string`, required): Registry to get entries from, you can use any registry in the game, or a custom registry provided by a mod. `"croparia:crops"` means this generator will generate files for each crop in Croparia IF.
- `whitelist` (`string[]`, optional): List of entry IDs to include. If specified, only entries from the `registry` above with IDs in this list will be processed.
- `path` (string that support placeholders, required): Path relative to the root of the pack handler's file-pack to place the generated files.
- `template` (string that support placeholders, required): Template for the generated file.

### ii. `croparia:aggregated`

If the files you are going to generate are not independent, for example, you want to generate an item tag that contains all
the crop seeds, you need to use `croparia:aggregated`.

In addition to the fields supported by [`croparia:generator`](#i-cropariagenerator), it also supports:
- `content` (string that support placeholders, required): This is the template of the unique content row for each entry.
The final content of the generated file will be constructed by putting all the content rows together. The final content
will not have indent, so you need to add indent spaces if necessary. The final content will have a comma and `\n`
between each content row, so you don't need to add comma at the end of the content row.
- `template` (string that support placeholders, required): This is the template for the whole generated file. Note that
you do not have access to the fields in the entry here, you can only use `${content}` that represents the final content
constructed by all the content rows.

### iii. `croparia:lang`

If you want to generate a language file that contains translations for each entry in a registry, you need to use
`croparia:lang`.

It has the same fields supported by [`croparia:generator`](#i-cropariagenerator). But it provides some special feature:
- Additional placeholder: `${lang}`, which represents the translation of the entry in the language you are generating.
- Pre-handled placeholder field: `_lang`, similar to `${lang}`, but it is used inside a placeholder that will be replaced
with the language name before the placeholder is parsed.

### iv. Recipe Wizard Generator

This is a special type of generator used by [Recipe Wizard](../recipe_wizard) to create recipes based on the environment
and your actions. It is not supported by pack handler, instead, it is loaded and used by Recipe Wizard item in the game.

The format is very similar to `croparia:generator`, but it has some special fields:
- No `type` and `registry` field.
- `block` ([`BlockInput`](spec_placeholder_registry#5-blockoutput), required): The block to match when you right-click a block with Recipe Wizard in hand. It can be a block ID, a tag, or a block state.
- `extensions` (`string[]`, optional): A list of Recipe Wizard Extensions that provide additional placeholders for the template. Refer to the [Recipe Wizard Extensions](./spec_placeholder_registry#recipe-wizard-extensions) documentation for more details.
