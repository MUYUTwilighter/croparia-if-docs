# Crops

If you think creating items, blocks, etc. is something can only be done by mod developers, you are wrong!

In Croparia IF, you can create your own crops with few simple steps, then Croparia IF will automatically generate the
corresponding items, blocks, and recipes for you!

Besides, you can also modify, or even disable the existing crops, so you can customize the gameplay to your liking.
