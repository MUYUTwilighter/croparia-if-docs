# Details: Elemental Stone (Elemental Soak)

<Pic src={require("@site/static/img/block/elemental_stone.webp").default} title="croparia:elemental_stone" fullWidth/>

Elemental Stone looks like a dull block, but it is actually a powerful tool that can soak elemental power into blocks
placed near it.

## Behavior

### Recipe Wizard

As elemental stone is defined with a recipe type, you can use the recipe wizard to create a new recipe in game.

Besides, you can use the recipe wizard to **set an infusor** on top of the elemental stone by right-clicking the
elemental stone while sneaking.

## Recipe Type: `croparia:elemental_soak`

Elemental Stone can soak elemental power from the infusor above into blocks placed near it.

<Pic src={'/img/recipe/elemental_infusor.webp'} title="Example: Elemental Infusor" fullWidth/>

The recipe consists of:
- **Input Block**: The block placed near the elemental stone.
- **Probability**: The chance of a successful soak.
- **Element Type**: The type of elemental power infused in the infusor above the elemental stone.
- **Output Block**: The result block produced after a successful soak.

The elemental soak will perform based on the random tick, so it might take a while to see the result.

**Note:** The element type of the infusor above the elemental stone will remain unchanged after a successful soak.
