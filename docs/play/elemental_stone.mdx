placed near it.

The recipe consists of:
- **Input Block**: The block placed near the elemental stone.
- **Element Type**: The type of elemental power infused in the infusor above the elemental stone.
- **Output Block**: The result block produced after a successful soak.

The elemental soak will perform based on the random tick, so it might take a while to see the result.

**Note:** The element type of the infusor above the elemental stone will remain unchanged after a successful soak.
