# Details: Ritual Stand

Ritual Stand is a core block in a multi-block structure used to sacrifice input blocks to transform input items into
output items.

    {src: require("@site/static/img/recipe/ritual_stand_2.webp").default, title: "croparia:ritual_stand_2"},
    {src: require("@site/static/img/recipe/ritual_stand_3.webp").default, title: "croparia:ritual_stand_3"}
]}/>

## Behavior

### Inventory Interaction

Ritual stands is an "item-placeable" block, which means you can place an item on top of it by right-clicking it with
the item in hand, or use the [dropper](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Dropper).

Besides, if a ritual is successful and produces the result item, the infusor will attempt to push the empty bottle or
result item into adjacent inventories (e.g., chests, hoppers) in the following order:
1. The block with container near or below it.
2. The player that interacted with it.

### Recipe Wizard

Ritual Stand is defined with a recipe type, so you can use the recipe wizard to create a new recipe in game.

Besides, you can use the recipe wizard to **build the ritual structure** by right-clicking while sneaking.

## Ritual Structure

A ritual requires a multi-block structure to perform a ritual. You can check REI for the structure.

Taking Ritual T1 as an example:

<Gallery pictures={[
    require("@site/static/img/recipe/ritual_1_1.webp").default,
    require("@site/static/img/recipe/ritual_1_2.webp").default,
    require("@site/static/img/recipe/ritual_1_3.webp").default
]}/>

It should be built like this:

<Gallery pictures={[
    require("@site/static/img/ritual_1_1.webp").default,
    require("@site/static/img/ritual_1_2.webp").default,
    require("@site/static/img/ritual_1_3.webp").default
]}/>

**Notes:**
- The directions are not strict, you can rotate the structure. But each layer must be built in the same direction.
- You need to read carefully by hovering your mouse over the blocks, as some blocks requires specific states.
  - For example, the image below shows that the ritual requires a fully grown coal crop:
  <Pic src={require("@site/static/img/recipe/ritual_1_2_coal.webp").default}/>
- You might see barrier blocks ![Barrier](https://minecraft.wiki/images/BlockSprite_barrier.webp?8d91a) in the structure
view, which means the positions can **ONLY** be air.
- You might see block with question mark
![Placeholder Item](https://github.com/MUYUTwilighter/croparia-if/blob/master/common/src/main/resources/assets/croparia/textures/item/placeholder.webp?raw=true)
in the structure view that says "Input block", which marks the positions where you should place the input blocks.

## Recipe Type: `croparia:ritual`

Even though the ritual stand does not have a GUI, it has a recipe type `croparia:ritual` that defines how the ritual
works. You can view the recipes in REI (or JEI/EMI).

<Pic src={'/img/recipe/potion_earth.webp'} title="Example: Potion of Earth" fullWidth/>

The recipe consists of:
- **Input Item**: The item placed on top of it.
- **Input Block**: The block placed in the proper positions.
- **Ritual Stand**: Indicates which ritual stand(s) is(are) available.
- **Output**: The result item produced after a successful infusion.

**Note A:** If the output item(s) is/are enchanted book(s), then the ritual will upgrade or enchant the input item
respectively with the enchantments from the book(s). The amount of books indicates the levels that will be applied, the
level of the enchantments in the book(s) indicates the maximum level that can be applied to the input item.

**Note B:** If the output item(s) is/are spawn egg(s), then the ritual will summon the entity/entities respectively.
