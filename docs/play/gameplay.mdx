# Gameplay Tutorial

Here we cover the basic gameplay of Croparia IF and some tips.

You may see [here](begin.md) for installation and some easy QAs.

## Getting Started

Once you get everything done and enter a world, you need firstly mine some _Elematilius_ in the cave.

<Pic src={require('@site/static/img/elematilius_in_cave.webp').default} title="Elematilius in Cave" fullWidth/>

This is a new ore added by Croparia IF. You can mine it with iron pickaxe or higher.

It is considerably rare and lies in deep caves, so you may need to explore a bit to find some.

---

Then, you need to prepare some resources.

**Infusor**: One of the core working blocks in Croparia IF. Uses stone bricks only.

<Pic src={require('@site/static/img/recipe/infusor.webp').default} title="Recipe to Infusor" fullWidth/>

**Elematilius Potion**: Used on infusor to infuse it with elemental power.

<Pic src={'/img/recipe/elematilius_potion.webp'} title="Elematilius Potion Recipe" fullWidth/>

**Seeds**: Any kind of seeds ![wheat seeds](/img/item/wheat_seeds.webp), e.g. wheat seeds, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc. We
need 4 seeds to get started.

---

Finally, we are ready to get our first **Croparia**! This item is used to craft various crop seeds that can grow all
kinds of resources.

<Pic src={'/img/recipe/croparia.webp'} title="Croparia Recipe" fullWidth/>

As shown in REI (or JEI/EMI), we need to learn how to use the infusor.

1. Place the infusor on the ground.
<Pic src={'/img/place_infusor.webp'} title="Place Infusor" fullWidth/>
2. Right click it with the elemental potion (Elematilius) to infuse it.
<Pic src={'/img/infuse_infusor.webp'} title="Infuse Infusor" fullWidth/>
3. Right-click it with input items (seeds) or throw the input items onto the infusor to start the infusion.
<Pic src={'/img/infusor_place_item.webp'} title="Place Items on Infusor" fullWidth/>

Now you have your first Croparia! You can use it to craft various crop seeds.

<Gallery pictures={[

        src: require("@site/static/img/recipe/coal_seeds.webp").default,
        title: "Coal Seeds Recipe"
    },
    {
        src: require("@site/static/img/recipe/leather_seeds.webp").default,
        title: "Leather Seeds Recipe"
    }
]}/>

## Tips: Use elemental soak to save your **Elematilius**

As we can see, each croparia requires 1 elematilius potion, and each potion requires 1 elematilius. This is quite expensive.

However, we can use *Elemental Stone* to soak existing infused infusors to save our precious elematilius.

<Pic src={'/img/recipe/elemental_stone.webp'} title="Recipe to Elemental Stone" fullWidth/>

_I think now you've learnt the infusor recipe, so let's move on._

By checking your recipe viewer like REI, you can see that the elemental stone can "spread" the infusion to other infusors.

<Pic src={'/img/recipe/elemental_infusor.webp'} title="Recipe to Infused Infusor" fullWidth/>

_The image might not demonstrate the element type, but you would see in the hover text_

This is **Elemental Soak**, which allows you to soak the elemental power into the input block and transform it into the
output block.

So, how to launch an elemental soak?

1. Place the elemental stone on the ground.
<Pic src={'/img/soak_place_elemental_stone.webp'} title="Place Elemental Stone" fullWidth/>
2. Place an infusor on top of the elemental stone.
<Pic src={'/img/soak_place_infusor.webp'} title="Place Infusor on Stone" fullWidth/>
3. Right click with an elemental potion to soak the infusor. In this case, we use an elematilius potion.
<Pic src={'/img/soak_infuse_infusor.webp'} title="Soak Infusor" fullWidth/>
4. Place the input blocks near the elemental stone (You don't have to fill all the positions). In this case, we place
the un-infused infusor.
<Pic src={'/img/soak_place_input_block.webp'} title="Place Input Block" fullWidth/>
5. Wait for a while, the input block (empty infusor) will transform into the output block (infused infusor) with a
"Ding" sound.
<Pic src={'/img/soak_output_block.webp'} title="Output Block" fullWidth/>

Therefore, we can use one elematilius potion to get multiple infused infusors, which can be used to craft multiple
croparias.

## Upgrade Croparia

As you might see in REI, there are several tiers of croparia, and different tiers can craft different seeds.

<Pic src={require('@site/static/img/item/croparias.webp').default} title="Croparia Variants" fullWidth/>

To upgrade croparia, you need different types of elemental potion. For example, t1 to t2 requires Potion of Earth.

<Pic src={'/img/recipe/croparia2.webp'} title="Croparia Tier 2 Recipe" fullWidth/>

And to get Potion of Earth, you need to learn the **Ritual**, which is a multi-block structure used to perform rituals.

<Pic src={'/img/recipe/potion_earth.webp'} title="Potion of Earth Recipe" fullWidth/>

---

So, let's get prepared to upgrade your croparia!

**Ritual Stand**: A working block used to sacrifice input blocks to transform input items into output items.

<Pic src={'/img/recipe/ritual_stand.webp'} title="Ritual Stand Recipe" fullWidth/>

**Some required blocks...**: You can check REI for the structure.

<Gallery pictures={[
    require("@site/static/img/recipe/ritual_1_1.webp").default,
    require("@site/static/img/recipe/ritual_1_2.webp").default,
    require("@site/static/img/recipe/ritual_1_3.webp").default
]}/>

As texts are limited, please refer to REI for the exact structure.

**Note:** In a cheat-able world, you can use Recipe Wizard to automatically build the ritual structure by right-clicking
the ritual stand while sneaking.

<Gallery pictures={[
    require("@site/static/img/ritual_1_1.webp").default,
    require("@site/static/img/ritual_1_2.webp").default,
    require("@site/static/img/ritual_1_3.webp").default
]}/>

When completed, you can throw an item or right-click on the ritual stand with an item to test if the structure is correct.

If it is correct, an overlay message "The Elematilius rejects your offerings." will appear.

If not, "The Elematilius does not respond to the ritual" will appear.

**Note: The crops must be fully grown.**

---

Once you have built the ritual structure, you can perform the ritual to get Potion of Earth.

1. Place the input block (Podzol) into the correct positions (Check your REI).
<Pic src={'/img/ritual_place_input_block.webp'} title="Place Input Block" fullWidth/>
2. Right-click the ritual stand with the input item (Elematilius), you will get the output item (Elemental Earth).
<Pic src={'/img/ritual_place_input_item.webp'} title="Place Input Item" fullWidth/>

With elemental earth, you can upgrade your croparia to t2, which can craft more seeds.

## Tips: Farm crop with Greenhouse

Once you have the crop seeds, you can plant them like normal seeds.

<Pic src={'/img/plant_seeds.webp'} title="Plant Seeds" fullWidth/>

Croparia IF add **Greenhouse** block, which can boost the growth speed of crops (not only croparia crops) and
auto-harvest them.

<Gallery pictures={[
    require("@site/static/img/greenhouse_place.webp").default,
    require("@site/static/img/greenhouse_container.webp").default
]}/>

Place it on top of a crop and it will work.

## Next...

Of course, there's much more to explore. You can check advancements and REI for more information.
