# Details: Infusor

<Pic src={require('@site/static/img/block/infusor.webp').default} title="croparia:infusor" fullWidth/>

The **Infusor** is a core working block in Croparia IF. It is used to infuse elemental power into the items placed on it.

## Behavior

### Infusing

Right-click the infusor with an **Elemental Potion** to infuse it. The potion will be consumed, and the infusor will be
infused with elemental power. The infusor can hold one type of elemental power at a time.

<Pic src={'/img/infuse_infusor.webp'} title="Infused Infusor (Elemental)" fullWidth/>

The infusor will retain its elemental power until an infusion occurred to the item above the infusor or manually cleared
with empty bottle.

Besides, you can place a [dispenser](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Dispenser), which contains elemental potions, towards an
infusor to automatically infuse it.

### Inventory Interaction

Infusor is an "item-placeable" block, which means you can place an item on top of it by right-clicking it with
the item in hand, or use the [dropper](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Dropper).

Besides, if any of the listed things happen:
- The infusor is successfully infused with an elemental potion and produces an empty bottle.
- An infusion to the item above the infusor is successful and produces the result item.

The infusor will attempt to push the empty bottle or result item into adjacent inventories (e.g., chests, hoppers) in
the following order:
1. The block with container near or below it.
2. The player that interacted with it.

### Recipe Wizard

Ritual Stand is defined with a recipe type, so you can use the recipe wizard to create a new recipe in game.

Besides, you can use the recipe wizard to **cycle the element type** of the infusor by right-clicking while sneaking.

## Recipe Type: `croparia:infusor`

Even though the infusor does not have a GUI, it has a recipe type `croparia:infusor` that defines how the infusion works.
You can view the recipes in REI (or JEI/EMI).

<Pic src={'/img/recipe/croparia.webp'} title="Example: Croparia T1" fullWidth/>

The recipe consists of:
- **Input**: The item placed on top of the infusor.
- **Element Type**: The type of elemental power infused in the infusor.
- **Output**: The result item produced after a successful infusion.
