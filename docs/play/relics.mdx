Relics are special items that can be summoned by the [Ritual](./ritual_stand.mdx#recipe-type-cropariaritual).

## Magic Rope

<Pic src={require("@site/static/img/recipe/magic_rope.webp").default} fullWidth/>

Summoned by Ritual T2, the Magic Rope can be used as "Teleport Anchor" to teleport you to the location where it was
bounded.

To bind the Magic Rope, right-click it towards the position you want to bind while sneaking. You will see a overlay
message that tells you the result, which is also shown in the hover text of the item.

To teleport to the bound position, right-click the Magic Rope to the ground. You will be teleported to the bounded
position. Cross-dimension teleportation is supported.

## Horn of Plenty

<Pic src={require("@site/static/img/recipe/horn_plenty.webp").default} fullWidth/>

Summoned by Ritual T2, the Horn of Plenty can be used to generate food by right-clicking it to the ground.

It will generate a random food item from the list of food items in the game, and consume the xp based on the nutrition
value of the food item and cool down 100 ticks (5 seconds).

An item tag `croparia:horn_plenty_blacklist` is used as blacklist for the food items that can be generated
by the Horn of Plenty. You can add your own food items to this tag to prevent them from being generated by the Horn of
Plenty.

## Midas Hand

<Pic src={require("@site/static/img/recipe/midas_hand.webp").default} fullWidth/>

Summoned by Ritual T3, the Midas Hand can be used to turn blocks into gold ingots, or turn mobs into gold blocks.

When used on a block, it will turn the block into a gold ingot, consume 10 exp from the player, and cool down for time based on how long you would break the block with your hand.

A block tag `croparia:midas_hand_immune` is used as blacklist for the blocks that are immune to the Midas Hand.

When used on a mob, it will turn the mob into a gold block, consume exp from the player based on the health of the mob
(doubled if enemy), and cool down for 200 ticks (10 seconds, doubled if enemy).

An entity-type tag `croparia:midas_hand_immune` is used as blacklist for the entities of types that are immune to the
Midas Hand.

## Infinite Apple

<Pic src={require("@site/static/img/recipe/infinite_apple.webp").default} fullWidth/>

Summoned by Ritual T3, the Infinite Apple is a special food that does not consume.

When you eat the Infinite Apple, it will restore 5 hunger points and 20 saturation points, and give you following effects for 100 ticks (5 seconds):
- **Regeneration 2**
- **Resistance**
- **Fire Resistance**
- **Absorption 4**

Then, it will cool down for 200 ticks (10 seconds) before you can eat it again.
